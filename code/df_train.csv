It is issued by a government agency, such as a county clerk's office or a state government, and is valid for a certain period of time, usually one year. After the marriage has taken place, the couple must obtain a marriage certificate, which is a document that records the marriage and is used to prove that the marriage took place.

The marriage license is valid for one year and there is no waiting period between the time you obtain the license and the time of the marriage.\n2.   Get married: After obtaining the marriage license, you can get married at any location of your choice, as long as it is legally recognized as a place to get married.\n3.   Obtain a marriage certificate: After the marriage has taken place, you need to obtain a marriage certificate from the same government agency that issued the marriage license.

Marriage License: A marriage license is a legal document that gives a couple permission to get married.

The couple is required to meet certain criteria, such as being of a certain age or not being closely related. Once the license is issued, there's often a waiting period before the marriage ceremony can take place. The marriage license has to be signed by the couple, their witnesses, and the officiant conducting the marriage ceremony, then returned to the license issuer for recording.\n\n2. Marriage Certificate: A marriage certificate, on the other hand, is a document that proves a marriage has legally taken place. It's issued after the marriage ceremony, once the signed marriage license has been returned and recorded.

I want to build a classifier.""]","[""Creating a test set for a very rare category can be challenging, as it may not be possible to collect a sufficient number of examples for the rare category. However, there are several strategies you can use to create a test set for a rare category:\n\n1. Use synthetic data: If the rare category is not present in any real-world data, you can create synthetic data to simulate the rare category. For example, you can use generative adversarial networks (GANs) or other techniques to generate synthetic examples of the rare category.\n2. Oversample the rare category: If you have a small number of examples of the rare category, you can oversample the rare category by creating additional examples of the rare category using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling).\n3. Use transfer learning: If you have a similar task or domain with a larger amount of data, you can use transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained model to your rare category. This can be useful if the rare category has similar characteristics to the more common categories.\n4. Use a class-balanced dataset: If you have a class-balanced dataset, you can use the rare category as a positive example and the more common categories as negative examples. This can help the model to learn to distinguish between the rare category and the more common categories.\n5. Use a dataset from a related domain: If you have a related domain with a larger amount of data, you can use the data from the related domain to create a test set for the rare category. For example, if you are working on a medical diagnosis task, you can use data from a related medical domain to create a test set for a rare disease.\n6. Use a combination of above strategies: You can use a combination of the above strategies to create a test set for a very rare category. For example, you can oversample the rare category, use transfer learning, and use a class-balanced dataset to create a test set for a very rare category.\n7. Use online data: You can use online data sources such as online forums, social media, or online databases to collect data for the rare category.\n8. Use expert annotation: If the rare category is related to a specific domain or expertise, you can use expert annotation to collect data for the rare category.\n9. Use active learning: You can use active learning to actively select the most informative examples from the rare category and label them manually.\n10. Use a different evaluation metric: If the rare category has a different distribution than the more common categories, you may need to use a different evaluation metric that is more appropriate for the rare category. For example, you can use the F1 score or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) instead of the accuracy.\n\nIt's important to note that creating a test set for a very rare category can be challenging, and it may not be possible to create a test set that is representative of the rare category. However, by using one or more of the above strategies, you can create a test set that is useful for evaluating the performance of your classifier.""]","[""When building a classifier for a very rare category, creating a test set can be challenging due to the limited amount of data available.

A bath tub is specifically designed to be filled with water for the purpose of bathing. You fill the tub with water, add bath salts or bubbles if you like, and then soak in the water to clean your body and relax.\n\nIf you are asking why water is not used in a bath tub in the same way that it is used in a swimming pool or a hot tub, there are a few reasons for this. First, bath tubs are much smaller than swimming pools or hot tubs, so they cannot hold as much water. This means that the water in a bath tub can get dirty and contaminated more quickly than the water in a larger body of water.\n\nAdditionally, bath tubs are not designed to be continuously filled with water. They are meant to be filled, used for bathing, and then drained. This helps to prevent the buildup of bacteria and other contaminants in the water.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that bath tubs are typically used for personal hygiene, and it is generally not recommended to share a bath tub with multiple people due to the risk of spreading germs. In contrast, swimming pools and hot tubs are often used by multiple people at the same time, so they need to be treated with chemicals to kill bacteria and other contaminants.""]","[""Water is not used in a bath tub because it is not a suitable medium for conducting electricity.
